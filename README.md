## Project Description:

The aim of this project is to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not based on various input features such as `Number of Pregnancies,Amount of Blood Glucose Level,Blood Pressure Value,Skin Thickness Value,Insulin Level,Body Mass Index Value,DiabetesPedigreeFunction Value,Age of the person`
. Machine learning algorithms has been used to analyze the input data and create a predictive model that can accurately predict the likelihood of a patient having diabetes. Here the Dataset that has been used is only about woman as it has a section of `Number of Pregnancies`. The Algorithm I have used here to fit the model is [**Support Vector Machines**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html). For deployment purpose I have used [**StreamLit**](https://streamlit.io/)
